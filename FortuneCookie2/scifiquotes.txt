It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply
because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be
in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must
be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by
infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average
population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be
zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe
is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are
merely the products of a deranged imagination.

lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V,
inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the
stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to
sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in
hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes
or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a
mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it
can't see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress

This is rather as if you imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, 'This is an interesting world I find myself in  an interesting hole I find myself in  fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.

For Children: You will need to know the difference between Friday and a fried egg. It's quite a simple difference, but an important one. Friday comes at the end of the week, whereas a fried egg comes out of a chicken. Like most things, of course, it isn't quite that simple. The fried egg isn't properly a fried egg until it's been put in a frying pan and fried. This is something you wouldn't do to a Friday, of course, though you might do it on a Friday. You can also fry eggs on a Thursday, if you like, or on a cooker. It's all rather complicated, but it makes a kind of sense if you think about it for a while.

Bypasses are devices that allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast while other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what's so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there, and what's so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there.

Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet.

And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more.

This is a complete record of its thoughts from the moment it began its life till the moment it ended it.

Ah ... ! Whats happening? it thought.

Er, excuse me, who am I?

Itll do ... perhaps I can find a better name for it later when Ive found out what its for. It must be something very important because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot of it. Hey! Whats this thing? This ... lets call it a tail  yeah, tail. Hey! I can can really thrash it about pretty good cant I? Wow! Wow! That feels great! Doesnt seem to achieve very much but Ill probably find out what its for later on. Now  have I built up any coherent picture of things yet?

...We now know the basic rules governing the universe, together with the gravitational interrelationships of its gross components, as shown in the theory of relativity worked out between 1905 and 1916. We also know the basic rules governing the subatomic particles and their interrelationships, since these are very neatly described by the quantum theory worked out between 1900 and 1930. What's more, we have found that the galaxies and clusters of galaxies are the basic units of the physical universe, as discovered between 1920 and 1930.

...The young specialist in English Lit, having quoted me, went on to lecture me severely on the fact that in every century people have thought they understood the universe at last, and in every century they were proved to be wrong. It follows that the one thing we can say about our modern 'knowledge' is that it is wrong...

My answer to him was, when people thought the Earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the Earth was spherical they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the Earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the Earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.

The basic trouble, you see, is that people think that 'right' and 'wrong' are absolute; that everything that isn't perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong.

However, I don't think that's so. It seems to me that right and wrong are fuzzy concepts, and I will devote this essay to an explanation of why I think so.

To say that love makes the world go around is to go too far. The Earth spins because it did so as it was formed and there has been nothing to stop it since. But the nearly maniacal devotion to sex and love by most of the plants, animals, and microbes with which we are familiar is a pervasive and striking aspect of life on Earth. It cries out for explanation. What is all this in aid of? What is the torrent of passion and obsession about? Why will organisms go without sleep, without food, gladly put themselves in mortal danger for sex? ... For more than half the history of life on Earth organisms seem to have done perfectly well without it. What good is sex?... Through 4 billion years of natural selection, instructions have been honed and fine-tuned...sequences of As, Cs, Gs, and Ts, manuals written out in the alphabet of life in competition with other similar manuals published by other firms.

'The hen,' said Samuel Butler, 'is the egg's way of making another egg.' It is on this level that we must understand what sex is for. ... The sockeye salmon exhaust themselves swimming up the mighty Columbia River to spawn, heroically hurdling cataracts, in a single-minded effort that works to propagate their DNA sequences into future generation. The moment their work is done, they fall to pieces. Scales flake off, fins drop, and soon--often within hours of spawning--they are dead and becoming distinctly aromatic.

They've served their purpose.

Nature is unsentimental.

Death is built in.

Books permit us to voyage through time, to tap the wisdom of our ancestors. The library connects us with the insight and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species. I think the health of our civilization, the depth of our awareness about the underpinnings of our culture and our concern for the future can all be tested by how well we support our libraries.

The idea that God is an oversized white male with a flowing beard, who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous. But if by 'God,' one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe, then clearly there is such a God. This God is emotionally unsatisfying... it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity.

Books, purchasable at low cost, permit us to interrogate the past with high accuracy; to tap the wisdom of our species; to understand the point of view of others, and not just those in power; to contemplate--with the best teachers--the insights, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, drawn from the entire planet and from all of our history. They allow people long dead to talk inside our heads. Books can accompany us everywhere. Books are patient where we are slow to understand, allow us to go over the hard parts as many times as we wish, and are never critical of our lapses. Books are key to understanding the world and participating in a democratic society.

Humans  who enslave, castrate, experiment on, and fillet other animals  have had an understandable penchant for pretending animals do not feel pain. A sharp distinction between humans and 'animals' is essential if we are to bend them to our will, make them work for us, wear them, eat them  without any disquieting tinges of guilt or regret. It is unseemly of us, who often behave so unfeelingly toward other animals, to contend that only humans can suffer. The behavior of other animals renders such pretensions specious. They are just too much like us.

The size and age of the Cosmos are beyond ordinary human understanding. Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home. In a cosmic perspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty. And yet our species is young and curious and brave and shows much promise. In the last few millennia we have made the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our place within it, explorations that are exhilarating to consider. They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky.

boys with deep problems communicating and that the decline in good sex
in America is coincident with the decline in drive-in movie theaters
from state to state.

California is going to sink into the sea when the big one comes, while
Florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic
waste.

candy really did taste better when I was a kid, that it's
aerodynamically impossible for a bumble bee to fly, that light is a
wave and a particle, that there's a cat in a box somewhere who's alive
and dead at the same time (although if they don't ever open the box to
feed it it'll eventually just be two different kinds of dead), and
that there are stars in the universe billions of years older than the
universe itself.

I believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and
oversees everything I do. I believe in an impersonal god who set the
universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and
doesn't even know that I'm alive. I believe in an empty and godless
universe of causal chaos, background noise, and sheer blind luck.

I believe that anyone who says sex is overrated just hasn't done it
properly. I believe that anyone who claims to know what's going on
will lie about the little things too.

I believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies. I believe in a
woman's right to choose, a baby's right to live, that while all human
life is sacred there's nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can
trust the legal system implicitly, and that no one but a moron would
ever trust the legal system.

life is what happens when you're alive and that you might as well lie

other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a
piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They did something dumb one day,
like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own

leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we
should be just friends' turns into a glass splinter working its way

When we hold each other, in the darkness, it doesn't make the darkness
go away. The bad things are still out there. The nightmares still
walking. When we hold each other we feel not safe, but better. "It's
all right" we whisper, "I'm here, I love you." and we lie: "I'll never
leave you." For just a moment or two the darkness doesn't seem so bad.

I think I fell in love with her, a little bit. Isn't that dumb? But it

of person you can tell anything to, no matter how bad, and they'll
still love you, because they know you. I wanted to go with her. I
wanted her to notice me. And then she stopped walking. Under the moon,
she stopped. And looked at us. She looked at me. Maybe she was trying
to tell me something; I don't know. She probably didn't even know I
was there. But I'll always love her. All my life.

There are a hundred things she has tried to chase away the things she
won't remember and that she can't even let herself think about because
that's when the birds scream and the worms crawl and somewhere in her
mind it's always raining a slow and endless drizzle.

You will hear that she has left the country, that there was a gift she
wanted you to have, but it is lost before it reaches you. Late one
night the telephone will sign, and a voice that might be hers will say
something that you cannot interpret before the connection crackles and
is broken.

Several years later, from a taxi, you will see someone in a doorway
who looks like her, but she will be gone by the time you persuade the
driver to stop. You will never see her again.

Whenever it rains you will think of her.

New Mistakes. Make glorious, amazing mistakes. Make mistakes nobody's
ever made before. Don't freeze, don't stop, don't worry that it isn't

Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you're there.

It doesn't matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that's like you after you take your hands away.

I cried because he would never do them again, he would never carve another piece of wood or help us raise doves and pigeons in the backyard or play the violin the way he did, or tell us jokes the way he did. He was part of us and when he died, all the actions stopped dead and there was no one to do them the way he did. He was individual. He was an important man. Ive never gotten over his death. Often I think what wonderful carvings never came to birth because he died. How many jokes are missing from the world, and how many homing pigeons untouched by his hands? He shaped the world.
