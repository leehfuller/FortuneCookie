Imagine that Cray computer decides to make a personal computer.  It has
a 150 MHz processor, 200 megabytes of RAM, 1500 megabytes of disk
storage, a screen resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels, relies entirely on
voice recognition for input, fits in your shirt pocket and costs $300.
What's the first question that the computer community asks?

"Is it PC compatible?"

From the Encyclopedia Galactica,

     Religion - No culture in the Galaxy knows everything about how the
Universe works.To circumvent their ignorance, many cultures imagine some
sort of higher being. Anything they can't explain is credited to, or blamed
on, this higher being, or God. Many such beliefs have in fact two deities,
one to praise, and one to blame. Others have large numbers, each assumed
responsible for one thing which the culture feels significant, eg Life,
Death, Gravity, Rain, Tea etc. Many cultures also believe that their set of
deities are the only true deities, and get quite upset if anyone suggests
otherwise. Many wars have been fought for this reason, despite the fact
that most of the deities being defended are usually supposed to advocate
peace, love and understanding.

Planet Earth is 4,600 years old.

	If we condense this inconceivable time-span into an understandable
concept, we can liken the Earth to a person of 46 years of age.
	Nothing is known about the first 7 years of this person's life, and
whilst only scattered information exists about the middle span, we know
that that only at the age of 42 did the Earth begin to flower.
	Dinosaurs and the great reptiles did not appear until one year ago,
when the planet was 45. Mammals arrived only 8 months ago; in the middle
of last week, human-like apes evolved into ape-like humans, and at the
weekend the last ice age enveloped the Earth.
	Modern humans have been around for four hours. During the last hour,
we discovered agriculture. The industrial revolution began a minute ago.
	During those sixty seconds of biological time, humans have made a
rubbish of Paradise.
	We have caused the extinction of many hundreds of animal species,
ransacked the planet for fuel and now stand like brutish infants gloating
over this meteoric rise to ascendency, on the brink of final mass extinction
and of effectively destroying this oasis of life in the solar system.

(3)    A logical picture of facts is a thought.

THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #18 -- FIFTH

FIFTH is a precision mathematical language in which the data types
refer to quantity.  The data types range from CC, OUNCE, SHOT, and
JIGGER to FIFTH (hence the name of the language), LITER, MAGNUM and
BLOTTO.  Commands refer to ingredients such as CHABLIS, CHARDONNAY,
CABERNET, GIN, VERMOUTH, VODKA, SCOTCH, and WHATEVERSAROUND.

The many versions of the FIFTH language reflect the sophistication and
financial status of its users.  Commands in the ELITE dialect include
VSOP and LAFITE, while commands in the GUTTER dialect include HOOTCH
and RIPPLE. The latter is a favorite of frustrated FORTH programmers
who end up using this language.

The temperature of Heaven can be rather accurately computed.  Our
authority is Isaiah 30%26, "Moreover, the light of the Moon shall be as
the light of the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold, as
the light of seven days."  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much
radiation as we do from the Sun, and in addition 7*7 (49) times as much
as the Earth does from the Sun, or 50 times in all.  The light we
receive from the Moon is one 1/10,000 of the light we receive from the
Sun, so we can ignore that ... The radiation falling on Heaven will
heat it to the point where the heat lost by radiation is just equal to
the heat received by radiation, i.e., Heaven loses 50 times as much
heat as the Earth by radiation.  Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for
radiation, (H/E)^4 = 50, where E is the absolute temperature of the
earth (-300K), gives H as 798K (525C).  The exact temperature of Hell
cannot be computed ... [However] Revelations 21%8 says "But the
fearful, and unbelieving ... shall have their part in the lake which
burneth with fire and brimstone."  A lake of molten brimstone means
that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point, 444.6C.  We
have, then, that Heaven, at 525C is hotter than Hell at 445C.

Hugh Downs' Four Rules for Investigating the Universe%
Rule #1-- When confronted with an apparent infinite or infinitely repeating
         pattern, expect some variant that keeps it from being infinite.
Rule #2-- When all investigation supports Rule 1, look for a situation which
         violates it.
Rule #3-- Be prepared for an infinite oscillation between Rules 1 and 2.
Rule #4-- Apply Rule 1.

   In modern Europe, as in ancient Greece, it would seem that even inanimate
objects have sometimes been punished for their misdeeds.  After the revocation
of the edict of Nantes, in 1685, the Protestant chapel at La Rochelle was
condemned to be demolished, but the bell, perhaps out of regard for its value,
was spared.  However, to expiate the crime of having rung heretics to prayers,
it was sentenced to be first whipped, and then buried and disinterred, by way
of symbolizing its new birth at passing into Catholic hands.  Thereafter it
was catechized, and obliged to recant and promise that it would never again
relapse into sin.  Having made this ample and honourable amends, the bell was
reconciled, baptized, and given, or rather sold, to the parish of St. 
Bartholomew.  But when the governer sent in the bill for the bell to the
parish authorities, they declined to settle it, alleging that the bell, as
a recent convert to Catholicism, desired to take advantage of the law lately
passed by the king, which allowed all new converts a delay of three years in 
paying their debts.

its value." ...  There is nothing in the Sarnoff statement that will bear 
scrutiny, for it ignores the nature of the medium, of any and all media, in

his own being in a new technical form. ... It has never occurred to General

Surely every human being ought to attain to the dignity of the unit.  Surely
it is worth while to be one, and to feel that the census of the universe
would be incomplete without counting you.  Surely there is grandeur in knowing
that in the realm of thought you are without a chain; that you have the right
to explore all heights and all depths; that there are no walls or fences, or
prohibited places, or sacred corners in all the vast expanse of thought; that
your intellect owes no allegiance to any being, human or divine; that you
hold all in fee, and upon no condition, and by no tenure, whatsoever; that
in the world of mind you are relieved from all personal dictation, and from
the ignorant tyranny of majorities.  Surely it is worth something to feel that
there are no priests, no popes, no parties, no governments, no kings, no gods,
to whom your intellect can be compelled to pay a reluctant homage.  Surely it
is a joy to know that all the cruel ingenuity of bigorty can devise no prison,
no dungeon, no cell in which for one instant to confine a thought; that ideas
cannot be dislocated by racks, nor crushed in iron boots, nor burned with
fire.  Surely it is sublime to think that the brain is a castle, and that
within its curious bastions and winding halls the soul, in spite of all worlds
and all beings, is the supreme sovereign of itself.

have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.

`for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.'

The brain is a beautifully engineered get-out-of-the-way machine that
constantly scans the environment for things out of whose way it should

trick: to predict the timing and location of dangers before they actually
happened.

Our ability to duck that which is not yet coming is one of the brain's most
stunning innovations, and we wouldn't have dental floss or 401(k) plans
without it. But this innovation is in the early stages of development. The
application that allows us to respond to visible baseballs is ancient and

Every Horse has an Infinite Number of Legs (proof by intimidation):
Horses have an even number of legs. Behind they have two legs, and in
front they have fore-legs. This makes six legs, which is certainly an
odd number of legs for a horse. But the only number that is both even
and odd is infinity. Therefore, horses have an infinite number of
legs. Now to show this for the general case, suppose that somewhere,
there is a horse that has a finite number of legs. But that is a horse
of another color, and by the [above] lemma ["All horses are the same
color"], that does not exist.

search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes fine-tuning. If someone is

a minute. 2. Man is a sick fly taking a dizzy ride on it. 3. Religion is the
theory that the wheel was designed and set spinning to give him the ride.

When a candidate for public office faces the voters he does not face men of
sense; he faces a mob of men whose chief distinguishing mark is the fact that
they are quite incapable of weighing ideas, or even of comprehending any save
the most elemental — men whose whole thinking is done in terms of emotion, and
whose dominant emotion is dread of what they cannot understand. So confronted,
the candidate must either bark with the pack or be lost... All the odds are on
the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre — the man who can
most adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum. The
Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected,
the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We
move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of
the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be
adorned by a downright moron.

We’ve bought into the idea that education is about training and
"success", defined monetarily, rather than learning to think critically
and to challenge. We should not forget that the true purpose of education
is to make minds, not careers. A culture that does not grasp the vital
interplay between morality and power, which mistakes management techniques
for wisdom, which fails to understand that the measure of a civilization
is its compassion, not its speed or ability to consume, condemns itself

Hope has a cost. Hope is not comfortable or easy. Hope requires personal
risk. It is not about the right attitude. Hope is not about peace of
mind. Hope is action. Hope is doing something. The more futile, the more
useless, the more irrelevant and incomprehensible an act of rebellion is,
the vaster and more potent hope becomes.  Hope never makes sense. Hope is
weak, unorganized and absurd. Hope, which is always nonviolent, exposes in
its powerlessness, the lies, fraud and coercion employed by the state. Hope
knows that an injustice visited on our neighbor is an injustice visited on
all of us. Hope posits that people are drawn to the good by the good. This
is the secret of hope's power. Hope demands for others what we demand for
ourselves. Hope does not separate us from them. Hope sees in our enemy

more destructive of that most fragile yet most precious commodity in our
entire intellectual heritage ― good teaching ― than a bill forcing
honorable teachers to sully their sacred trust by granting equal treatment
to a doctrine not only known to be false, but calculated to undermine any
general understanding of science as an enterprise?

The brain is a beautifully engineered get-out-of-the-way machine that
constantly scans the environment for things out of whose way it should
right now get. That's what brains did for several hundred million years ―
and then, just a few million years ago, the mammalian brain learned a new
trick: to predict the timing and location of dangers before they actually
happened.

Our ability to duck that which is not yet coming is one of the brain's most
stunning innovations, and we wouldn't have dental floss or 401(k) plans
without it. But this innovation is in the early stages of development. The
application that allows us to respond to visible baseballs is ancient and
reliable, but the add-on utility that allows us to respond to threats that
loom in an unseen future is still in beta testing.

Every Horse has an Infinite Number of Legs (proof by intimidation):
Horses have an even number of legs. Behind they have two legs, and in
front they have fore-legs. This makes six legs, which is certainly an
odd number of legs for a horse. But the only number that is both even
and odd is infinity. Therefore, horses have an infinite number of
legs. Now to show this for the general case, suppose that somewhere,
there is a horse that has a finite number of legs. But that is a horse
of another color, and by the [above] lemma ["All horses are the same
color"], that does not exist.

sometimes connote points along a continuum. FROB connotes aimless

search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes fine-tuning. If someone is
turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it
he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the

reluctant to turn back upon the frontier of this epoch. Space is
indifferent to what we do; it has no feeling, no design, no interest in
whether or not we grapple with it. But we cannot be indifferent to space,
because the grand, slow march of intelligence has brought us, in our
generation, to a point from which we can explore and understand and utilize
it. To turn back now would be to deny our history, our capabilities.

The reason ESP, for example, is not considered a viable topic in
contemporary psychology is simply that its investigation has not proven
fruitful...After more than 70 years of study, there still does not exist
one example of an ESP phenomenon that is replicable under controlled
conditions. This simple but basic scientific criterion has not been met
despite dozens of studies conducted over many decades... It is for this
reason alone that the topic is now of little interest to psychology... In
short, there is no demonstrated phenomenon that needs explanation.

use them because they enable you to get to the heart of the problem that you
want to do, instead of having to concentrate on the mechanics of getting the
program going as fast as you possibly can, which is really nothing more than
doing a sort of crossword puzzle.

The truth is that Christian theology, like every other theology, is not only

days the church as an organization has thrown itself violently against every
effort to liberate the body and mind of man. It has been, at all times and

When a candidate for public office faces the voters he does not face men of
sense; he faces a mob of men whose chief distinguishing mark is the fact that
they are quite incapable of weighing ideas, or even of comprehending any save
the most elemental — men whose whole thinking is done in terms of emotion, and
whose dominant emotion is dread of what they cannot understand. So confronted,
the candidate must either bark with the pack or be lost... All the odds are on
the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre — the man who can
most adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum. The
Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected,
the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We
move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of
the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be

Hope has a cost. Hope is not comfortable or easy. Hope requires personal
risk. It is not about the right attitude. Hope is not about peace of
mind. Hope is action. Hope is doing something. The more futile, the more
useless, the more irrelevant and incomprehensible an act of rebellion is,
the vaster and more potent hope becomes.  Hope never makes sense. Hope is
weak, unorganized and absurd. Hope, which is always nonviolent, exposes in
its powerlessness, the lies, fraud and coercion employed by the state. Hope
knows that an injustice visited on our neighbor is an injustice visited on
all of us. Hope posits that people are drawn to the good by the good. This
is the secret of hope's power. Hope demands for others what we demand for
ourselves. Hope does not separate us from them. Hope sees in our enemy
our own face.

It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply
because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be
in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must
be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by
infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average
population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be
zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe
is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are
merely the products of a deranged imagination.

A towel, [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy] says, is about the
most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can
have. Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you
for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can
lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V,
inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the
stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to
sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in
hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes
or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a
mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it
can't see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress
signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be
clean enough.

It's quite a simple difference, but an important one. Friday comes at the end of the week,

The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies,

politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.  Think of the endless cruelties

are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.  Think of the rivers of blood spilled

there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

my position is mistaken,' and then they would actually change their minds and you never

Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. 
When we recognize our place in an immensity of light years and in the passage of ages, 
when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, 
that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions 
in the presence of great art or music or literature, or acts of exemplary selfless courage 
such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. The notion that science

The earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood 
spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and in triumph they could 
become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties 
visited by the inhabitants of one corner of the dot on scarcely distinguishable 
inhabitants of some other corner of the dot. How frequent their misunderstandings, 
how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, 
our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in 
the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck

Fireflies out on a warm summer's night, seeing the urgent, flashing, yellow-white phosphorescence 
below them, go crazy with desire; moths cast to the winds an enchantment potion that draws the 
opposite sex, wings beating hurriedly, from kilometers away; peacocks display a devastating 
corona of blue and green and the peahens are all aflutter; competing pollen grains extrude 
tiny tubes that race each other down the female flower's orifice to the waiting egg below; 
luminescent squid present rhapsodic light shows, altering the pattern, brightness and color 
radiated from their heads, tentacles, and eyeballs; a tapeworm diligently lays a hundred 
thousand fertilized eggs in a single day; a great whale rumbles through the ocean depths 
uttering plaintive cries that are understood hundreds of thousands of kilometers away, 
where another lonely behemoth is attentively listening; bacteria sidle up to one another 
and merge; cicadas chorus in a collective serenade of love; honeybee couples soar on 
matrimonial flights from which only one partner returns; male fish spray their spunk 
over a slimy clutch of eggs laid by God-knows-who; dogs, out cruising, sniff each other's 
nether parts, seeking erotic stimuli; flowers exude sultry perfumes and decorate their 
petals with garish ultraviolet advertisements for passing insects, birds, and bats; and 
men and women sing, dance, dress, adorn, paint, posture, self-mutilate, demand, coerce, 
dissemble, plead, succumb, and risk their lives.

To say that love makes the world go around is to go too far. The Earth spins because it 
did so as it was formed and there has been nothing to stop it since. But the nearly maniacal 
devotion to sex and love by most of the plants, animals, and microbes with which we are familiar 
is a pervasive and striking aspect of life on Earth. It cries out for explanation. What is all 
this in aid of? What is the torrent of passion and obsession about? Why will organisms go 
without sleep, without food, gladly put themselves in mortal danger for sex? ... For more 
than half the history of life on Earth organisms seem to have done perfectly well without it. 
What good is sex?... Through 4 billion years of natural selection, instructions have been 
honed and fine-tuned...sequences of As, Cs, Gs, and Ts, manuals written out in the alphabet 
of life in competition with other similar manuals published by other firms. The organisms 
become the means through which the instructions flow and copy themselves, by which new 
instructions are tried out, on which selection operates.

'The hen,' said Samuel Butler, 'is the egg's way of making another egg.' It is on this 
level that we must understand what sex is for. ... The sockeye salmon exhaust themselves 
swimming up the mighty Columbia River to spawn, heroically hurdling cataracts, in a 
single-minded effort that works to propagate their DNA sequences into future generation. 
The moment their work is done, they fall to pieces. Scales flake off, fins drop, and 
soon--often within hours of spawning--they are dead and becoming distinctly aromatic.

They've served their purpose.

Nature is unsentimental.

Death is built in.

dying. They don't teach you anything worth knowing.

Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so
vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it
means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up
all these defenses, you build up a whole suit of armor, so that
nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any
other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a
piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They did something dumb one day,
like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own
anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and
leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we
should be just friends' turns into a glass splinter working its way
into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in
the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart

wanted her to notice me. And then she stopped walking. Under the moon,

There are a hundred things she has tried to chase away the things she
won't remember and that she can't even let herself think about because
that's when the birds scream and the worms crawl and somewhere in her
mind it's always raining a slow and endless drizzle.

You will hear that she has left the country, that there was a gift she
wanted you to have, but it is lost before it reaches you. Late one
night the telephone will sign, and a voice that might be hers will say
something that you cannot interpret before the connection crackles and
is broken.

Several years later, from a taxi, you will see someone in a doorway
who looks like her, but she will be gone by the time you persuade the
driver to stop. You will never see her again.

A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair

way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people 
look at that tree or that flower you planted, you're there.

It doesn't matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something 
from the way it was before you touched it into something that's like 
you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man

A stranger is shot in the street, you hardly move to help. But if, 
half an hour before, you spent just ten minutes with the fellow 
and knew a little about him and his family, you might just jump

Not knowing, or refusing to know is bad, or amoral, at least.

You're a hopeless romantic," said Faber. "It would be funny if it 
were not serious. It's not books you need, it's some of the things 
that once were in books. The same things could be in the 'parlor families' 
today. The same infinite detail and awareness could be projected through 
the radios, and televisors, but are not. No,no it's not books at all 
you're looking for! Take it where you can find it, in old phonograph 
records, old motion pictures, and in old friends; look for it in nature 
and look for it in yourself. Books were only one type or receptacle 
where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget. 
There is nothing magical in them at all. The magic is only in what books 
say, how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one 
garment for us. Of course you couldn't know this, of course you still 
can't understand what i mean when i say all this. You are intuitively 
right, that's what counts.

Learning tolet goshould be learned before learning toget.Life should

of the waterfall coming nearer and nearer, tidy up the boat, put on 
your best tie and hat, and smoke a cigar right up till the moment 
you go over. That's a triumph.

If you don't want a man unhappy politically, don't give him two sides 
to a question to worry him; give him one. Better yet, give him none. 
Let him forget there is such a thing as war. If the government is 
inefficient, top-heavy, and tax-mad, better it be all those than that 
people worry over it. Peace, Montag. Give the people contests they 
win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of 
state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of 
noncombustible data, chock them so damned full of 'facts' they feel stuffed, 
but absolutely 'brilliant' with information. Then they'll feel they're
